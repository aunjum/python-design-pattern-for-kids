The Memento design pattern is like a magic trick that helps you save and restore memories. Imagine you are playing a game and you want to save your progress. You take a picture of your game screen and keep it in your pocket. Later on, if you want to go back to where you were before, you take out the picture and use it to restore your progress.

The Memento design pattern works similarly in software. It allows you to save the state of an object at a specific time and later restore it to that state. This can be useful when you need to undo changes or roll back to a previous version of an object.

To use the Memento pattern, you need three things: a Memento, an Originator, and a Caretaker. The Originator is the object whose state you want to save and restore. The Memento is an object that stores the state of the Originator at a specific time. The Caretaker is an object that keeps track of the Mementos.

When you want to save the state of the Originator, you create a new Memento object and pass it the state of the Originator. The Memento then stores this state for later use. When you want to restore the state of the Originator, you ask the Caretaker for the Memento that contains the state you want to restore. The Caretaker returns the Memento, which you then pass to the Originator to restore its state.

Overall, the Memento design pattern is a way to save and restore memories in software, much like taking a picture to remember where you left off in a game.
