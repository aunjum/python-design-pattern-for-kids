Do you know what an iterator is? It's like a helper that helps you go through a bunch of things, one by one. For example, imagine you have a bunch of toys in a toy box, and you want to go through each toy and play with them. You could use an iterator to help you with that.

The Iterator design pattern is a way to help you go through a bunch of things (like toys in a toy box) one by one, without having to know too much about how the things are stored or organized.

For example, let's say we have a class called ToyBox that holds a bunch of toys. We could create an Iterator class that helps us go through each toy one by one, without having to know too much about how the toys are stored inside the ToyBox.
